%%%%%% TODO LIST %%%%%%

--- dinnerModel.js ---
- fix getNumberOfGuests function
- fix all functions (so that the imagined functionalities of the prototype will work)
  How to test: change data directly in the dinnerModel (dishes) and the change should show up on all screens

--- dishSearchView.js ---
x make searchBox case UNsensitive
- add listener to searchButton for pressing enter on keyboard

--- dinnerStatusView.js ---
- use getNumberOfGuests function to display people??? or is it overwriting dishSearchView???

--- 01 selectdish.html ---
- fix cost and dish name labels

--- 01overview.html ---
- nav and article are overlapping

--- 01style.css ---
- implement styling to replicate prototype
- check if we can delete body {} style function
- labels function not working properly. Goal is to get some air around labels. Remove breaks and fix labelpadding
